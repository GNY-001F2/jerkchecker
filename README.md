## jerkchecker

This program was created as a joke and should not be taken seriously under any circumstances.

This program provides a list of jerks based on their userids and a function to append more jerks.
This reference implementation does asserts that once a person is a jerk, he is always a jerk (no exceptions),
therefore does not provide a function to remove jerks from the list.

An example usage is shown in in main().

Please feel free to extend its functionality and do whatever you want with the code as long as it does not violate the GPLv2. Licensing under later versions of the GPL is expressly forbidden.

I (GNY-001F2, aka duelistgamer) reserve all copyright to the program.
